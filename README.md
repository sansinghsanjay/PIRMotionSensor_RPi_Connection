# Intro Project: PIR Motion Sensor and Raspberry Pi Connection
This is a basic, intro project, explaining that how to connect Raspberry Pi with PIR Motion Sensor.

## Raspberry Pi
In this intro project, I have used "Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2" board. 

OS is "Raspbian - Jessie (8)"

Python installed in this OS: Python 2.7.9

## PIR Motion Sensor
PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, available on Amazon. Several blogs are live on Internet for the details of this sensor. Hence, I am sharing few crucial details about this sensor:
1. Range: up to 10 meters (approx.), but sensitivity is good up to 6 meters
2. Angular Coverage: 70° to 110°
3. Power Required: 3.3V to 5V

Following is the picture of PIR Motion Sensor used here:
